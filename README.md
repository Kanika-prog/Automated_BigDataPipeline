# Automated_BigDataPipeline
Developed an automated data pipeline using Microsoft Azure and Databricks to support a local photography competition. The pipeline scans images uploaded to a cloud storage container, extracts metadata using AI-based cloud services, and stores the metadata in a database for judges and organizers to view via a Power BI dashboard.
